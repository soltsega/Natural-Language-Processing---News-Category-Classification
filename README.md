# News Category Classification

A comprehensive NLP pipeline for classifying news articles into four major categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. This project leverages the AG News dataset to demonstrate end-to-end text classification using Python, Scikit-learn, and optional deep learning techniques.

## Structure
- `data/`: Dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing and modeling.
- `models/`: Trained models.

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore the data and train models.
